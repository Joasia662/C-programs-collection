## Tasks Instructions:

**1. Calculator**<br>
>Create a simple menu of your calculator according to the diagram Menu:<br>
>a) Addition, <br>b) Subtraction,<br> c) Multiplication,<br> d) Division<br>  e) Root<br> f) Exponentiation <br>g) Mathematical factorial  <br>h) Roots of the quadratic equation q) Exit <br><br>
>The user selects the action number from the Menu by loading the value of the char type variable from the keyboard. On the basis of the user's choice, the program performs the selected operation on the two variables (except of Roots of the quadratic equation - in this variant the operation is perfomed on the three variable) of the double type entered by the user. When using the instructions that control the execution of the program, to each item in the menu, add the appropriate code that performs the appropriate arithmetic operations on the variables. A variable of double type is returned as the result of the operation.

**2. Hangman The Game**<br>
>Implement a hangman game in the C language.<br>
> - The user has to guess the password within a certain number of tries: two more than the letters in the password to be guessed.
> - The password to be guessed can be entered permanently in the program code as a fixed-value variable or randomly selected from different categories, so that the next time the program is started, you will receive a different password to refuse.
> - It presents the current view of the password with guessed and not yet guessed letters at a given stage of the game. 
> - The program asks the user to enter a letter from the keyboard and checks if it appears in the searched password.
> - If the entered letter is found in the password, the program copies it to the table, in the specified places - revealing the guessed password letters.
> - In the next step, the current sample number and the contents of the table with the letters hit in the previous steps are displayed.
> - The program runs until all available trials are exhausted or until all letters in the password are guessed.

> Additional game options:<br>
>1. Allowing at each stage of the game, to provide the entire password to be verified.<br>
>2. Reduction of attempts, only in the case of missing a letter from the password.<br>
>3. Automatic password selection.
